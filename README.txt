Hi
I'm a very new programmer and this is my first ever programming project which i actually wrote.
This took about 6 hours.
The game works 100% there are some to do items listed on the top tho.
A known bug is that you can turn twice in the same "tick", thereby crashing into your own tail.
I gave my best to explain what each part of the code does via comments.
